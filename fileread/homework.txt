Homework:

* Refactor lexer from last week to read from a file specified on the command line.
    * Update the make file to no longer provide stdin redirection (remove the '<').
    * Read the first file specified in argv
    * open and read the file into a buffer allocated via malloc
    * specify the read-in buffer as the lex buffer
    * the lexer should behave as it did before
    * clean up when complete
    * for fun: print an error message if the file does not exist
